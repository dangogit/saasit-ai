# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SaasIt.ai is a visual AI agent team orchestrator that enables users to create AI development teams that build real applications using Claude Code SDK. The platform allows users to design workflows visually through a drag-and-drop canvas, selecting from 40+ specialized AI agents.

## Essential Commands

### Frontend Development (React + Tailwind)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # Install dependencies
npm start             # Start development server (uses craco)
npm run build         # Build for production
npm test              # Run tests
```

### Backend Development (FastAPI + MongoDB)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install Python dependencies
uvicorn server:app --reload        # Start development server
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
# No specific lint/typecheck commands configured - consider adding eslint

# Backend
cd backend
black .               # Format Python code
isort .               # Sort imports
flake8                # Lint Python code
mypy .                # Type check Python code
pytest                # Run tests
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Structure
- **Technology**: React with Craco configuration, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand (see `lib/stores/workflowStore.js`)
- **UI Components**: Custom components in `src/components/ui/` based on Radix UI
- **Main Features**:
  - `LandingPage.jsx`: Entry point
  - `WorkflowDesigner.jsx`: Main application interface
  - `AgentCanvas.jsx`: Visual workflow builder using React Flow
  - `ChatPanel.jsx`: AI assistant interface
  - `AgentLibrary.jsx`: Agent selection panel
  - `ExecutionPanel.jsx`: Real-time execution monitoring

### Backend Structure
- **Technology**: FastAPI with Motor (async MongoDB driver)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- **Database**: MongoDB with async operations
- **Current Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/`: Health check
  - `POST /api/status`: Create status check
  - `GET /api/status`: List status checks

### Key Integration Points
1. Frontend expects backend API at `/api/*` endpoints
2. CORS is configured to allow all origins (development mode)
3. MongoDB connection via environment variables

## Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Backend requires `.env` file with `MONGO_URL` and `DB_NAME`
2. **Path Aliases**: Frontend uses `@/` alias for `src/` directory
3. **Hot Reload**: Can be disabled via `DISABLE_HOT_RELOAD=true` environment variable

## Important Implementation Notes

- The project is in early development stage with basic scaffolding
- Frontend has comprehensive UI component library but limited feature implementation
- Backend has minimal endpoints - needs expansion for full functionality
- No authentication/authorization implemented yet
- Mock data available in `frontend/src/data/mock.js`

## Agent System (Planned)
The platform will support 40+ specialized agents across categories:
- Engineering (rapid-prototyper, frontend-developer, backend-architect, etc.)
- Design (ui-designer, ux-researcher, brand-guardian, etc.)
- Marketing (growth-hacker, content-creator, tiktok-strategist, etc.)
- Product (feedback-synthesizer, trend-researcher, sprint-prioritizer)
- Operations (analytics-reporter, finance-tracker, infrastructure-maintainer, etc.)
- Testing (api-tester, performance-benchmarker, test-results-analyzer, etc.)
- Project Management (project-shipper, experiment-tracker, studio-producer)

## Next Development Steps
Based on the project documentation, priority areas include:
1. Implementing workflow creation and storage APIs
2. Building out the visual canvas functionality with React Flow
3. Creating agent execution engine integration
4. Adding authentication and user management
5. Implementing real-time WebSocket communication for execution updates

## System Architecture Updates

### Infrastructure Configuration
- Added Cloudflare Pages for frontend hosting
- Migrated backend to Fly.io
- Configured MongoDB Atlas connection (with current SSL challenges)
- Implemented basic API proxy through Cloudflare's _redirects

### Deployment Strategy
- Containerized backend with Docker
- Environment variables managed via Fly.io secrets
- Cloudflare CDN for static asset delivery
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

### Technology Stack Refinements
- Frontend: React with Craco, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- Backend: FastAPI with Motor, Uvicorn ASGI server
- State Management: Zustand
- Visualization: React Flow for workflow designer

### Pending Technical Improvements
- Resolve MongoDB SSL connection issues
- Implement comprehensive user authentication
- Expand API endpoints for workflow management
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Integrate Claude Code SDK for AI agent execution
- ⏺ I can see the Clerk test mode credentials from your
  screenshot. These test credentials are useful for
  development and testing:

  - Test Email: your_email+clerk_test@example.com (or
  any email with +clerk_test subaddress)
  - Test Verification Code: 424242
  - Test Phone Number: +15555550100 (last 3 digits can
  be 100-199)

  These test credentials will work in Clerk's test mode
  without sending actual emails or SMS messages. The
  verification code 424242 can be used to bypass the
  normal verification flow during development and
  testing.

- Agent System Prompt Location

  Main File: /Users/danielgoldman/Desktop/projects/saasit-ai/backend/services/claude_service.py

  Key Components:

  1. System Prompt Builder (lines 154-219): The _build_system_prompt() method in the WorkflowGenerator class
  2. Agent Context Loader (/Users/danielgoldman/Desktop/projects/saasit-ai/backend/services/agent_loader.py):
   Loads all agent definitions from the /agents directory
  3. Agent Definitions: Individual agent files in /Users/danielgoldman/Desktop/projects/saasit-ai/agents/
  organized by category

  System Prompt Structure:

  The system prompt includes:
  - Core responsibilities (lines 189-194)
  - Dynamic agent context (loaded from agent_loader.build_agent_context())
  - Conversation flow (lines 198-207)
  - Workflow format specification (lines 158-185)
  - Questioning strategy (lines 211-217)

  How It Works:

  1. AgentLoader scans the /agents directory for .md files
  2. Each agent file has YAML frontmatter with metadata (name, description, tools, etc.)
  3. build_agent_context() creates a summary of all available agents by category
  4. This context gets injected into the system prompt dynamically
  5. The system prompt guides Claude to create workflows using these agents

  The system prompt is currently designed for workflow generation and agent orchestration, focusing on
  helping users build AI development teams through conversational planning.
- ✅ Completed Components

  Backend Infrastructure:
  - Execution Models (app/models/execution.py): Complete data models for executions, steps, terminal output,
  and WebSocket messaging
  - Execution Service (app/services/execution_service.py): Core execution orchestration with WebSocket
  notification system
  - WebSocket Router (app/routers/websocket.py): Real-time /ws/execution/{execution_id} endpoint with
  authentication
  - REST API Endpoints (app/routers/executions.py): Full CRUD operations for execution management
  - Database Integration: MongoDB indexes and schema optimized for execution queries

  Frontend Real-Time Interface:
  - Enhanced Zustand Store: Complete execution state management with real-time updates
  - ExecutionWebSocketService: Robust WebSocket client with reconnection and message handling
  - Real-Time ExecutionPanel: Live terminal display with syntax highlighting, filtering, and progress
  tracking
  - WorkflowDesigner Integration: Seamless execution initiation from workflow canvas

  Key Features Implemented:
  - 🔄 Real-time Progress Tracking: Step-by-step execution monitoring with live status updates
  - 💻 Terminal Output Streaming: Live terminal with syntax highlighting, filtering, and auto-scroll
  - 🔒 JWT Authentication: Secure WebSocket connections with token validation
  - 📊 Progress Visualization: Real-time progress bars and status indicators
  - ⚡ Execution Control: Start/pause/resume/cancel operations via WebSocket
  - 🔄 Auto-Reconnection: Robust WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff
  - 📱 Responsive UI: Mobile-friendly execution monitoring interface

  🔧 Architecture Highlights

  The system follows a microservice bridge pattern with:
  - Real-time WebSocket streaming for execution updates
  - Server-Sent Events protocol for one-way terminal output
  - JWT-based authentication with rate limiting by user tier
  - MongoDB TTL indexes for automatic log cleanup
  - Connection pooling and memory management

  �� Ready to Test

  I've created a comprehensive test script (test_execution_system.py) that verifies:
  - Backend health and API endpoints
  - WebSocket connection and authentication
  - Real-time message streaming
  - End-to-end execution workflow

  The system is now ready for:
  1. Local development testing with the mock execution simulator
  2. Claude Code SDK integration (remaining task)
  3. Production deployment with real AI agent execution
