# SaasIt.ai - Complete Project Documentation

## Executive Summary

**SaasIt.ai** is a visual AI agent team orchestrator that enables developers and non-developers to create AI development teams that build real applications using Claude Code SDK. Users design workflows visually, selecting from 40+ specialized AI agents, then either export the configuration for local Claude Code execution or run it in our cloud infrastructure.

**Core Value Proposition**: "Design your AI dev team visually, then watch them build your app together"

## Problem Statement

1. **For developers with Claude Code**: Need to optimize multi-agent workflows without complex coding
2. **For non-Claude Code users**: Want access to Claude Code's power without the subscription
3. **For everyone**: Orchestrating multiple AI agents for complex projects is difficult and unintuitive

## Solution Overview

### What We're Building
- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Drag-and-drop canvas for assembling AI agent teams
- **Agent Marketplace**: 40+ specialized agents (from rapid-prototyper to growth-hacker)
- **Cloud Execution Service**: Run workflows without Claude Code access
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch agents work and collaborate in real-time
- **Export Capability**: Generate Claude Code SDK configurations for local execution

### Key Differentiators
1. **Visual Team Building**: No code required to orchestrate agents
2. **Live Execution Canvas**: See AI agents working in real-time
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Export or cloud execution
4. **Auto-Optimization**: AI helps design better teams
5. **Accessibility**: Claude Code power without Claude Code access

## User Journey

### Discovery → Design → Execute → Deliver

1. **User arrives** seeking to build an app
2. **Describes their idea** in natural language via chat
3. **AI suggests agent team** based on requirements
4. **User customizes team** via drag-and-drop canvas
5. **Executes workflow** (cloud or export)
6. **Receives Git repository** with complete application
