# Branch Protection Setup Guide

This guide helps you configure GitHub branch protection rules to ensure all tests pass before merging to main.

## 🛡️ Setting Up Branch Protection

### 1. Navigate to Branch Protection Settings

Go to your GitHub repository:
```
https://github.com/dangogit/saasit-ai/settings/branches
```

### 2. Configure Main Branch Protection

Click **"Add rule"** and configure:

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

**Protection Rules to Enable:**

✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
- ✅ Require approvals: 1 (or 0 if you're working solo)
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require review from code owners (optional)

✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- **Required status checks:**
  - `Backend Tests`
  - `Frontend Tests` 
  - `Code Quality`
  - `Integration Tests`
  - `Test Summary`

✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

✅ **Require signed commits** (optional but recommended)

✅ **Include administrators** (applies rules to admins too)

## 🔄 Workflow Process

With branch protection enabled:

### For Pull Requests:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and push: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
3. Create PR to main branch
4. **CI Tests automatically run** (5 test jobs)
5. **All tests must pass** before merge is allowed
6. Merge PR → **Auto-deploy triggers**

### For Direct Pushes (if allowed):
1. Push to main → **CI Tests run immediately**
2. If tests pass → **Auto-deploy triggers**
3. If tests fail → **Deployment blocked**

## 🧪 Test Jobs That Must Pass

### Backend Tests
- Unit tests for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Security tests for authentication and authorization

### Frontend Tests  
- Build verification (compilation)
- E2E tests with Playwright across browsers
- Accessibility compliance tests
- Component functionality tests

### Code Quality
- Python code formatting (Black)
- Import sorting (isort)
- Type checking (mypy, if configured)
- Frontend linting (ESLint, if configured)

### Integration Tests
- Full-stack integration with real backend
- End-to-end user workflows
- Cross-service communication verification

## 🚨 Failure Handling

**If any test fails:**
- ❌ Merge is blocked
- 📧 PR author gets notification
- 🔍 View detailed logs in GitHub Actions
- 🔧 Fix issues and push updates
- ✅ Tests re-run automatically

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Zero broken deployments** - tests catch issues before production
- **Code quality enforcement** - maintains high standards automatically  
- **Team confidence** - everyone knows main branch always works
- **Faster debugging** - issues caught early with clear error messages

## 🛠 Manual Override (Emergency Only)

Admins can bypass protection rules if absolutely necessary:
- Go to the failing PR
- Click "Merge without waiting for requirements"
- **Use sparingly** - defeats the purpose of protection

## 📊 Monitoring

Monitor your CI health:
- **GitHub Actions tab** - view all test runs
- **PR status checks** - see which tests passed/failed
- **Branch protection insights** - track rule effectiveness

Your main branch is now protected with comprehensive testing! 🛡️
